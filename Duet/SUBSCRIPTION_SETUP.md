# RevenueCat Subscription Setup - Implementation Complete

This document outlines the RevenueCat subscription integration that has been implemented in your Duet app.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Subscription Infrastructure

- **Models** (`Models/SubscriptionModels.swift`):
  - `SubscriptionStatus` - tracks user subscription state
  - `SubscriptionPackage` - represents subscription plans
  - `SubscriptionOffering` - groups of packages
  - `PurchaseResult` - purchase flow results

- **Service** (`Services/SubscriptionService.swift`):
  - RevenueCat SDK initialization and configuration
  - User login/logout management
  - Subscription status checking
  - Purchase and restore functionality
  - Usage access control (subscription OR credits)

- **ViewModel** (`ViewModel/SubscriptionViewModel.swift`):
  - UI state management for subscription views
  - Purchase flow handling
  - Error and success state management

### 2. User Interface Components - Two Approaches

#### **Approach 1: Custom Paywall (Full Control)**

- **Pro Badge** (`Views/Components/ProBadge.swift`):
  - `ProBadge` - small badge for profile header
  - `ProMemberCard` - full card for subscription management
  - Different appearances for subscribed vs non-subscribed users

- **Custom Paywall** (`Views/Subscription/SubscriptionPaywallView.swift`):
  - Beautiful image carousel with promotional content
  - Custom subscription plan selection
  - Purchase and restore functionality
  - Modern, clean design with animations

#### **Approach 2: RevenueCat Native Paywall (Managed by RevenueCat)**

- **RevenueCat Pro Components** (`Views/Components/ProBadge.swift`):
  - `RevenueCatProBadge` - uses `.presentPaywallIfNeeded()`
  - `RevenueCatProMemberCard` - automatic paywall presentation
  - Zero configuration required - RevenueCat handles everything

- **Test View** (`Views/Subscription/RevenueCatTestView.swift`):
  - Complete testing interface for RevenueCat features
  - Manual paywall presentation with `PaywallView`
  - Subscription status monitoring
  - Debug and testing utilities

### 3. App Integration

- **DuetApp.swift**: 
  - RevenueCat SDK initialization on app startup
  - Environment object setup

- **AuthenticationViewModel.swift**:
  - RevenueCat user authentication integration
  - Automatic login/logout with Firebase auth state changes

- **ProfileView.swift**:
  - **Toggle system** to switch between custom and native paywalls
  - Pro badge integration (replaces credit badge when subscribed)
  - Test view access for easy debugging

### 4. Usage Logic Updates

Updated endpoints to check subscription status before deducting credits:

- **DateIdeaViewModel**: `/summarise` endpoint
- **ProcessingManager**: Both `/summarise` and `/groups/add-url` endpoints

Now works as: If user is subscribed â†’ allow action without deducting credits. If not subscribed â†’ check credits and deduct if sufficient.

## RevenueCat Native vs Custom Paywall

### **RevenueCat Native Paywall (.presentPaywallIfNeeded)**

**Advantages:**
- âœ… **Zero configuration** - RevenueCat handles everything
- âœ… **Automatic updates** - New features and improvements from RevenueCat
- âœ… **A/B testing** - Built-in conversion optimization
- âœ… **Intro offers** - Automatically handles free trials and discounts
- âœ… **Localization** - Supports multiple languages out of the box
- âœ… **Platform compliance** - Always follows App Store guidelines

**Usage:**
```swift
.presentPaywallIfNeeded(
    requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "Pro",
    purchaseCompleted: { customerInfo in
        print("Purchase completed!")
    },
    restoreCompleted: { customerInfo in
        print("Purchases restored!")
    }
)
```

### **Custom Paywall (Your Design)**

**Advantages:**
- âœ… **Full design control** - Matches your app's exact branding
- âœ… **Custom content** - Show specific features and benefits
- âœ… **Advanced layouts** - Complex designs with carousels, animations
- âœ… **A/B testing your way** - Test your own designs

**Usage:**
- Complete control over presentation timing
- Custom animations and transitions
- Branded experience

## Setup Completion Steps

### 1. RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration

1. Create products in RevenueCat dashboard with entitlement ID: `"Pro"`
2. Configure your App Store Connect products
3. Test with sandbox users

### 2. Choose Your Approach

**Testing both approaches:**
1. Open ProfileView in your app
2. Use the "Paywall Testing" toggle to switch between approaches
3. Tap "Open RevenueCat Test View" for comprehensive testing
4. Test both Pro badges and member cards

**For production, choose one:**
- **RevenueCat Native**: Set `useRevenueCatPaywall = true` 
- **Custom Paywall**: Set `useRevenueCatPaywall = false`

### 3. Replace Placeholder Images (Custom Paywall Only)

Replace the placeholder files with your actual promotional images:
- `Assets.xcassets/duet-landing.imageset/` 
- `Assets.xcassets/duet-group.imageset/`
- `Assets.xcassets/duet-star.imageset/`

### 4. API Key Configuration

The app expects `RevenueCatAPIKey` in `Info.plist`, which should be set via build configuration:
```xml
<key>RevenueCatAPIKey</key>
<string>$(REVENUECAT_API_KEY)</string>
```

### 5. Backend Integration (Optional)

If you want to sync subscription status with your backend:
- Add webhook endpoints to receive RevenueCat events
- Update user subscription status in your database
- Add subscription status to user profile API responses

## How It Works

### User Flow - RevenueCat Native

1. **New Users**: See "Get Pro" badge 
2. **Tap Pro Badge/Card**: RevenueCat paywall appears automatically
3. **Purchase**: RevenueCat handles the entire flow
4. **Success**: User gets "PRO" badge and unlimited access

### User Flow - Custom Paywall

1. **New Users**: See "Get Pro" badge and upgrade prompts
2. **Tap Pro Badge/Card**: Custom paywall with image carousel appears
3. **Purchase**: Custom UI with RevenueCat purchase logic
4. **Success**: User gets "PRO" badge and unlimited access

### Technical Flow

1. **App Launch**: RevenueCat initializes with API key
2. **User Login**: RevenueCat user ID set to Firebase UID (automatic)
3. **Subscription Check**: Status refreshed automatically
4. **Purchase**: RevenueCat handles the App Store transaction
5. **Usage**: Service checks subscription status before credit deduction

## Testing & Debugging

### **RevenueCat Test View**
Access via ProfileView â†’ "Open RevenueCat Test View":
- View current subscription status
- Test manual paywall presentation
- Refresh subscription data
- Debug subscription state

### **Profile Toggle**
Switch between approaches in ProfileView:
- Toggle "RevenueCat Native" vs "Custom Paywall" 
- Test both pro badges and member cards
- Compare user experiences

### **Testing Checklist**
1. **Sandbox Testing**: Use sandbox App Store accounts
2. **Both Approaches**: Test RevenueCat native and custom paywalls
3. **Subscription States**: Test subscribed and non-subscribed flows  
4. **Credit Integration**: Verify credits are not deducted when subscribed
5. **UI States**: Test pro badge vs credit badge display
6. **Purchase Flow**: Test purchase, cancellation, and restore

## Recommendation

For most apps, **RevenueCat Native Paywall** is recommended because:
- Automatic optimization and updates
- Built-in best practices
- Less maintenance required
- Professional, tested UI

Use the **Custom Paywall** if you need:
- Specific branding requirements
- Complex custom layouts
- Unique user flows

## Notes

- Both implementations work seamlessly with your existing credit system
- Subscription status is checked in real-time via RevenueCat
- Pro badge shows different states (active subscription vs upgrade prompt)
- All existing credit purchase flows remain unchanged
- Easy to switch between approaches during development and testing

The implementation provides maximum flexibility - you can use either approach or even A/B test between them! ðŸš€
